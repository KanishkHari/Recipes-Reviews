# High Protein Recipes vs. High Fat Recipes: Which Recipes Tend to be Rated Higher?
Authors: Kanishk Hari and Derek Huang
## Overview
This data science project, conducted at UCSD, focuses on the comparison between recipes that have high protein and recipes that have high fat, and how ratings are impacted based on the type of recipe. 
## Introduction
## Univariate Analysis

For our univariate analysis plot, we decided to analyze the proportion of high protein recipes less than or equal to 100 on the PDV. This is because some recipes have a protein PDV that is greater than 100, and we want to filter recipes based on recipes that have attainable PDVs.
